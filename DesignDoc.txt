Nocturne Dream App Design Doc


Let’s combine your ideas cleanly:  “First Light AI” An AI-powered dream + inspiration + micro-goal tracker. 
Core Flow: Morning check-in (dream or mood) 
AI generates: 3 keywords 1 reflection sentence 1 micro-goal 
User marks goal complete 
App tracks emotional + goal patterns 

That’s enough for a strong demo.


Extra features:
Level up system with some sort of progression tracking (maybe streaks?)
Includes achievements ofc
Colors that dynamically change in the background depending on mood (suppose LLM would scan them and think of colors?)
Badges based on goals (Gemini image creation)



SPEC SHEET:


User authenticates with Firebase Auth
User enters dream in text box
Text box goes -> Firestore DB
MAKE THIS INTO JSON
Pipe JSON -> Cloud Function
Cloud Function -> AI call
AI ‘does stuff’, reports back
